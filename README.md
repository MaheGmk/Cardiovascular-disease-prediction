# Cardiovascular-disease-prediction

Objective: To build a model and to classify the patients to be healthy or suffering from cardiovascular 
disease based on the given attributes. People with high readings of CVD factors with high risk of Cardio 
vascular disease need early detection and management where machine learning models can be of great 
help.
Outcome: Recall score of 91% is achieved on test set using Logistic model.
Key skills: Python, pandas, EDA, SLC, visualization.


CAPSTONE-2021.ipynb has the python code and Capstone project.pdf has the project details.
